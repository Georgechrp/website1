about_text: I am Nikola Tesla, an inventor driven by vision more than by wealth.
  My mind is consumed by ideasâ€”of energy, light, wireless power, and machines
  that move the world forward. I was born in 1856, and ever since I can
  remember, I have sought to harness the forces of nature for the benefit of
  humankind. Alternating current was but a beginning. My work spans wireless
  communication, remote control, and devices yet to be understood. I do not care
  if others take the credit, as long as the world moves ahead with what I have
  discovered.
